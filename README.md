# MBIS-Assignment



This is the repo for code of the group assignment for MBIS623-25S2.



The intial database schema can be created from either the `before\_extension.mwb` or by running the `build\_schema.sql`.



This can then be seeded by running the `seed\_db.sql` file. This should only be done ONCE as re-running this will cause the keys to not work, as the auto-incremention will cause them to get all funky. 



### TODO:



Extend the database (for q3).
